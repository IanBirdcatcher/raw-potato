<header>What is it like to be a Computer Science Major?</header>
<p>Being a computer science major at a small university comes with a unique set of experiences. For many students, the smaller class sizes make it easier to build close relationships with professors and peers, creating a strong sense of community where everyone is more than just a face in the crowd. Professors are approachable and genuinely invested in their students' progress, often engaging in deeper discussions and encouraging involvement in projects outside of the standard coursework. This personalized support adds a lot to the learning experience.</p>

<p>While the curriculum may not be as broad or specialized as at larger universities - with fewer classes on niche topics like machine learning or advanced cybersecurity - this limitation often encourages students to take the initiative. Many find themselves seeking additional resources like online courses, open-source projects, or independent study to dive deeper into areas of personal interest.</p>

<p>Hands-on experience is one of the significant advantages. With fewer students, there are more opportunities to engage in meaningful projects, whether through research with a professor, organizing events like hackathons, or contributing to student organizations. Group projects are a big part of the coursework, emphasizing collaboration and teamwork. Through these experiences, students learn essential skills like version control, project management, and effective communication - all critical in the tech world.</p>

<p>However, there are some challenges. Resources can be limited, with computer labs or facilities not always equipped with the latest technology. Connecting with big tech companies can be more challenging since career fairs and on-campus recruiting events tend to be smaller. These obstacles often push students to be more proactive, developing skills in networking, reaching out to alumni, and finding internships or conferences independently.</p>

<p>Overall, being a computer science major at a small university means enjoying close connections, personalized learning, and plenty of hands-on experience. It also requires students to be resourceful and self-directed, finding opportunities to explore their interests in creative ways.</p>
